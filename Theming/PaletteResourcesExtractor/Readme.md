##  Palette Resources Extractor 

This is a tool that allows you to extract the ResourceDictionary files for all Telerik themes that support palettes. This tool is supported after Telerik version 2023.2.703 (LIB release).

The extracted ResourceDictionary files or only some of their resources can be merged in your WPF project. Changing the values of the resources after merging them will replace the default values (colors, thickness, radiuses, fonts, etc.), thus affecting the Telerik controls' appearance.
