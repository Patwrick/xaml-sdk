##  Draw On Document

The example shows how you can setup RadPdfViewer in a way that allows you to draw directly over a document. Once a document is loaded, using the mouse left button click, hold and move on the page allowing you to draw over the document. After finishing the drawing, the document can be later saved through the Save As button in the toolbar.
To enable the UI, a custom UI layer is implemented (DrawUILayer.cs).
