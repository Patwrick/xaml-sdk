##  Add Document Content 

The example shows how you can setup RadPdfViewer in a way that allows you to add text content to a document. Once a document is loaded, clicking on the page opens a text box allowing you to insert the desired text. After modifying the content, it can be later saved through the Save As button in the tool bar. The logic uses PdfProcessing and its integration with PdfViewer to achieve the goal.

To enable the UI, a custom UI layer is implemented (AddTextUILayer.cs).
