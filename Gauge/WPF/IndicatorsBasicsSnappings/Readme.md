## Indicators Basics Snappings
The Snapping feature allows the gauge to display values only for a fixed positions or values which match a specific interval. An example for snapping is the following scenario - you are interested to point values 5 and 10 on the gauge, and want all the values between 5 and 10 to be shown as the closest from these two (i.e. 6 will be shown as 5 and 9 will be shown as 10).
