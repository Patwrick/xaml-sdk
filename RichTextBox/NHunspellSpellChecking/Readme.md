## NHunspell spell checking
The example demonstrates how to create and work with a custom third-party spell checker using [NHunspell](http://www.crawler-lib.net/nhunspell).

###Using OpenOffice dictionaries###
In order to open an .OXT dictionary file, you have to unzip it. This file contains .AFF and .DIC files, which have to be passed to the HunspellSpellChecker constructor to be used by the NHunspell library.

* The dictionary used for this SDK example could be downloaded at http://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/us-english-spell-checking-dictionary.
