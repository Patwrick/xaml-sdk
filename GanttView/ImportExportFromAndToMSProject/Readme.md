## Import Export From And To MSProject
This example demonstrates how to import XML MS Project files into RadGanttView and export RadGanttView to MSProject using the COM Interop binary Microsoft.Office.Interop.MSProject.

**Important:** The Microsoft.Office.Interop.MSProject binary is a primary interop assembly that interoperate with existing COM types. Because of that you need to have MSProject installed on your computer in order to use the export functionality of the example.
