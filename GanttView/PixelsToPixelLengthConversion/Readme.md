## Pixels to PixelLength conversion
This example demonstrates how the conversion between real Pixels and the PixelLength property of the RadGanttView control is calculated. You can enter pixels (double) in the TextBlock and press enter or the convert button to convert those Pixels into PixelLength and instantly see the result in the RadGanttView control. The same could be done by entering PixelLength (TimeSpan) in the TextBlock.
