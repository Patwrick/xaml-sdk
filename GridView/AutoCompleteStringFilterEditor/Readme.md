## Filter Editor With Autocomplete
This example demonstrates how you can extend a string column, so that its field filter editors have the auto-complete functionality. 
To achieve this, a custom AutoCompleteFilterStringColumn is defined.
When you open the FilteringControl for that column and start typing in any of the editors, an auto-complete dropdown will appear.
