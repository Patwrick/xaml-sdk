## Binding to ICustomTypePovider
This example demonstrates how an object implementing the ICustomTypePovider interface can be defined and bound to RadGridView.
In WPF the interface is available only in .NET 4.5 or higher and to run the example you should open in Visual Studio and replace the existing binaries with the ones in the WPF45 folder.
