## Area Series
The area series can be SplineAreaSeries and normal AreaSeries which correspond to the SplineSeries and LineSeries respectively. The area series are behave just like the spline and line series but they also allow the area between the curve/lines and the corresponding axis to be colored in an arbitrary way.
