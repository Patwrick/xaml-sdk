## Information Layer Map Shape Fill
The ColorMeasureScale can apply a different color to each range it creates. You are able to specify the desired set of colors not only for the normal fill of the shapes, but for the highlighted one too. This is done by using the ShapeFillCollection and HighlightFillCollection properties. They are collections of MapShapeFill objects.
