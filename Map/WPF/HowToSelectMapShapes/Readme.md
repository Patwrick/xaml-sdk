## How To Select Map Shapes
RadMap provides a rich set of geocoordinate-enabled shapes that can be defined and displayed onto the map surface. There are scenarios, however, where you would like to do more than just position a shape onto the map. This example will demonstrate how to manipulate each individual segment of line/polyline/polygon shape based on mouse input from the user. For example we will select (highlight) a Line segment of the Polyline and set a green color for it. The Polyline itself will be colored blue and on click it will become red. All these customizations will be made through styles.
