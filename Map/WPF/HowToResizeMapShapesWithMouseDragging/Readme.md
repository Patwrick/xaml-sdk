## Resize Map Shapes With Mouse
RadMap provides a rich set of geocoordinate-enabled shapes that can be defined and displayed onto the map surface .There are scenarios, however, where you would like to do more than just position a shape onto the map. This example will demonstrate how to manipulate each individual segment of line/polyline/polygon shape based on mouse input from the user. For example we will select (highlight) a point, and drag the selected object to another location on the map â€“ modifying in this way the shape or the line segment.
