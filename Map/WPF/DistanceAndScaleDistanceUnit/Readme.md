## Distance And Scale Distance Unit
RadMap uses two measure units for distance - mile and kilometer. The measure units determine the placement of the MapShapes, as their width and height are measured in the selected unit. You can specify the unit using the DistanceUnit property of RadMap. The default value is Kilometer.
