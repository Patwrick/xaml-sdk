## Ip Address
The IP address demo shows how you can edit an IP Address with MaskedTextInput and validate it.
Demo uses the ValueMode property of the MaskedTextInput so that decimal separators of the IP Address are included in the Value property.
This makes it easier to parse and validate the address.
